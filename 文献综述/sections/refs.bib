  abstract  = {When a new bug report is received, developers usually need to reproduce the bug and perform code reviews to find the cause, a process that can be tedious and time consuming. A tool for ranking all the source files of a project with respect to how likely they are to contain the cause of the bug would enable developers to narrow down their search and potentially could lead to a substantial increase in productivity. This paper introduces an adaptive ranking approach that leverages domain knowledge through functional decompositions of source code files into methods, API descriptions of library components used in the code, the bug-fixing history, and the code change history. Given a bug report, the ranking score of each source file is computed as a weighted combination of an array of features encoding domain knowledge, where the weights are trained automatically on previously solved bug reports using a learning-to-rank technique. We evaluated our system on six large scale open source Java projects, using the before-fix version of the project for every bug report. The experimental results show that the newly introduced learning-to-rank approach significantly outperforms two recent state-of-the-art methods in recommending relevant files for bug reports. In particular, our method makes correct recommendations within the top 10 ranked source files for over 70\% of the bug reports in the Eclipse Platform and Tomcat projects.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the use of Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to automate the localization of buggy files, given a bug report, has shown promising results. The abundance of approaches in the literature, however, contrasts with the reality of IR-based bug localization (IRBL) adoption by developers (or even by the research community to complement other research approaches). Presumably, this situation is due to the lack of comprehensive evaluations for state-of-the-art approaches which offer insights into the actual performance of the techniques.  We report on a comprehensive reproduction study of six state-of-the-art IRBL techniques. This study applies not only subjects used in existing studies (old subjects) but also 46 new subjects (61,431 Java files and 9,459 bug reports) to the IRBL techniques. In addition, the study compares two different version matching (between bug reports and source code files) strategies to highlight some observations related to performance deterioration. We also vary test file inclusion to investigate the effectiveness of IRBL techniques on test files, or its noise impact on performance. Finally, we assess potential performance gain if duplicate bug reports are leveraged.},

  abstract  = {Given a bug report of a project, the task of locating the faults of the bug report is called fault localization. To help programmers in the fault localization process, many approaches have been proposed, and have achieved promising results to locate faulty files. However, it is still challenging to locate faulty methods, because many methods are short and do not have sufficient details to determine whether they are faulty. In this paper, we present BugPecker, a novel approach to locate faulty methods based on its deep learning on revision graphs. Its key idea includes (1) building revision graphs and capturing the details of past fixes as much as possible, and (2) discovering relations inside our revision graphs to expand the details for methods and calculating various features to assist our ranking. We have implemented BugPecker, and evaluated it on three open source projects. The early results show that BugPecker achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 0.263 and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.291, which improve the prior approaches significantly. For example, BugPecker improves the MAP values of all three projects by five times, compared with two recent approaches such as DNNLoc-m and BLIA 1.5.},

  abstract  = {Current statistical language modeling techniques, including deep-learning based models, have proven to be quite effective for source code. We argue here that the special properties of source code can be exploited for further improvements. In this work, we enhance established language modeling approaches to handle the special challenges of modeling source code, such as: frequent changes, larger, changing vocabularies, deeply nested scopes, etc. We present a fast, nested language modeling toolkit specifically designed for software, with the ability to add \& remove text, and mix \& swap out many models. Specifically, we improve upon prior cache-modeling work and present a model with a much more expansive, multi-level notion of locality that we show to be well-suited for modeling software. We present results on varying corpora in comparison with traditional N-gram, as well as RNN, and LSTM deep-learning language models, and release all our source code for public use. Our evaluations suggest that carefully adapting N-gram models for source code can yield performance that surpasses even RNN and LSTM based deep-learning models.},

  abstract = {Automatic bug localization, i.e., automatically locating potential buggy source files given a bug report, plays an essential role in software engineering. For instance, bug localization helps developers fix bugs quickly. Although information retrieval-based bug localization methods are simple and easy to understand, it is difficult for them to bridge the lexical gap between bug reports and programs and capture the rich structural information in programs. Deep learning-based bug localization (DLBL) methods can utilize the structural information of the program, but they cannot handle long code sequences well. For example, CNN fails to capture remote code interaction features, while RNN (like LSTM, GRU) is vulnerable to gradient disappearance or burst when facing long code sequences. Additionally, DLBL methods fail to model metadata features such as bug-fixing recency and frequency. In this paper, we research how to locate buggy files by learning function-level features. Specifically, we propose a new framework called FLIM that can extract semantic features of a program at the function level and then calculates the relevance between natural and programming language by aggregating function-level interactions. We leverage a fine-tuned language model to treat the bug localization task as a code retrieval task, and use a learning-to-rank model to fuse the function-level semantic features with IR features to calculate the final relevance. We evaluate FLIM by conducting extensive experiments on widely-used six software projects. Experimental results demonstrate that FLIM outperforms six state-of-the-art methods of bug localization.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many fault localization approaches recently utilize deep learning to learn an effective localization model showing a fresh perspective with promising results. However, localization models are generally learned from class imbalance datasets; that is, the number of failing test cases is much fewer than passing test cases. It may be highly susceptible to affect the accuracy of learned localization models. Thus, in this paper, we explore using data resampling to reduce the negative effect of the imbalanced class problem and improve the accuracy of learned models of deep-learning-based fault localization. Specifically, for deep-learning-based fault localization, its learning feature may require duplicate essential data to enhance the weak but beneficial experience incurred by the class imbalance datasets. We leverage the property of test cases (i.e., passing or failing) to identify failing test cases as the duplicate essential data and propose an iterative oversampling approach to resample failing test cases for producing a class balanced test suite. We apply the test case resampling to representative localization models using deep learning. Our empirical results on eight large-sized programs with real faults and four large-sized programs with seeded faults show that the test case resampling significantly improves fault localization effectiveness.},
